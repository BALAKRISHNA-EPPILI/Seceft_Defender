# Introduction:
The project SECEFT DEFENDER (security theft ) defender describes that
As, nowadays we know that protecting our personal belongings ,data , or perosnal things to keep it safe and secure from others either it's in form of money ,data, jewelleries , etc. ….
What everyone is doing that , they are keeping their money safe at their home by using automatic or secure locked locker at their home or ,some people's put these things in their bank lockers , and for a big companies like MnC their data is so much crucial and they wants to safe their data from their competitors ….so, if I take example of bank then, bank has the responsibilty of protecting locker facility so, that any thief will not come and theft all people perosnal belongings. And If I say , that after bank timings become over and it is closed then, who is responsible for that ? For securing and keep an eye on bank lockers ,etc. So, in this type of situation What they actually do is that they  hired a guard …and  cctv's cameras are established but …guard is human being to whom the theives can easily do unconscious and also using advanced technologies they can dismiss the CTVS cameras as well and stile all things from bank lockers …or same is the case of co pany ….so, what if I say that ….I have an advanced solution of all of your this problems using which you can protect your personal belongs ,data etc ..
Yes, actually the solution of this problem is where this Idea arises …
SECEFT DEFENDER (security theft ) defender ..this is a prototype model wn which we are using some sensors for keep an eye on the theives  these sensors are Ultrasonic sensor , …PIR sensor and laser sensor ..and if in any case, one sensor failed or disabled then others are their for working …and the excited feature of this prototype is that …..you can establish or purchase this at a very minimal or affordable cost … 

As ,you all have seen in some of the movies that they are using laser technology for protecting their crucial data …so, laser technology is a very advanced technology and protected technology and if all sensors fails but there is always a backup and more protected solution is laser one cannot get rid from laser light and it caught the thief and it become easy for the others to protect their data ….

So, this is just a small and brief overview on our idea ….


This is what our project describes. .. 

Now ,let's come to the purpose of our project …
